# De-Cyber
## Description -
World war 3 is not just a war of nuclear weapons, it’s a cyber war as well. You are fighting for your nation (`team name`). Help your soldiers win the war by neutralizing opposition communications and weapons by decrypting their passwords (in the form of questions) and getting your hold on them.

## General Instructions-

Players will have to bring their own laptops.\
Players can participate in the form of teams of maximum 3 players or individually.\
Teams would have to get themselves registered beforehand.\
The event will be conducted on a website which will be handled by MACS.

## Rules -

Each team will be assigned a country and army initially.\
There will be a single map which will be common for all the players, all the teams’ respective countries will be located on the map.\
Players can capture countries by breaking their defense (1 question) and having the required army points.\
Capturing a country will award some country points, each country will have different points depending on the level of difficulty.\
However, capturing a country will reduce your army points.\
Teams will have to rebuild the army(army points) by solving an extra set of questions which will only consist of simple puzzles.\
Once a country is captured, it cannot be captured by any other teams.\
The team with the most country points at the end of the event will be declared the winner.

## Round/Levels-

Army related questions will only consist of simple puzzles.\
Capturing questions can range from deciphering, problem solving, decoding,riddles,puzzles,etc. The difficulty of the questions would be from easy to moderate.\
All the teams will be given access to all country related questions at the start of the event, so there won’t be any levels.\
The team with the most country points at the end of the event will be chosen as the winner.
